This week's lab is a continuation of the previous week. We explore the role of both *siting*--the location and activity--in interaction, as well as the *form and appearance* of the robot in the interaction.


## Prep

### For this lab, you will need:
1. Paper
2. Markers/ Pens
3. Scissors/Utility Knifes
4. Smart Phone -- The main required feature is that the phone needs to have a browser and display a webpage.
5. **Found objects and materials** -- You will have to costume your CloneBot so that it fits in the intended setting. These materials can include doll clothes, a paper lantern, a bottle, human clothes, a pillow case, etc. Be creative! We have fabric, just ask!
   




### Deliverables for this lab are: 

0. Fill in the questions along the way! 
1. 1 photo of costumed device
2. Reflections on the process
3. Video sketch of 1 prototyped interactions with costumed device
4. Submit the items above in the lab2 folder of your class [Github page], either as links or uploaded files. Each group member should post their own copy of the work to their own Lab Hub, even if some of the work is the same from each person in the group.

### The Report 
This README.md page in your own repository should be edited to include the work you have done (the deliverables mentioned above). Following the format below, you can delete everything but the headers and the sections between the **stars**. Write the answers to the questions under the starred sentences. Include any material that explains what you did in this lab hub folder, and link it in your README.md for the lab.

## Lab Overview
For this assignment, you are going to:

A) [Provide feedback to your peers](#part-a-provide-feedback)

B) [Site the interaction](#part-b-site-the-interaction)

C) [Costume the robot](#part-c-costume-the-robot)

D) [Wizard the robot](#part-d-wizard-the-robot) 

E) [Video record the interaction](#part-e-record)

Labs are due on Tuesdays before class. Make sure this page is linked to on your main class hub page.

## Part A. Provide Feedback
You and your teammates will be assigned lab 1 submissions from one other group. Go to their github pages, view their videos, and provide them with reactions, suggestions & feedback: explain to them what you saw happening in their video. Guess the scene and the goals of the character. Ask them about anything that wasn’t clear.

**Summarize feedback your feedback here.**
My response: Wow, your robots are clearly thoughtfully designed and well-implemented. The angel bot is cute and has some semblance of emotional intelligence; the butter has comedy and usefulness; the charger bot is super useful and intelligent. 
Robot-specific feedback, questions, and ideas: 
- Does the charger bot need to stay there for the entire duration of the charging process? Can it detach itself or move away when the charging is happening? Maybe it could also indicate when the device is done charging, so the human does not keep their device plugged in for too long. 
- The angel bot is really sweet. It seems that most of the functionality comes from the servo motor on top, which has a pretty limited motion option. I think what you have works, but you may need to think about the material and presentation for whatever you attach to it.
- I think the butter bot is so funny. The shaking back and forth is such a clever way to execute the emotion of anguish that a robot can feel about only having the purpose of being a butter bot. 

## Part B. Site the interaction

Think about where the interaction you are prototyping is going to occur-- on a desk? on a floor? indoors? outdoors?

What other people and objects are in that space?

What activities are going on in that space? What activity is the robot going to be involved in?

\*\***Sketch and/or take photos of the site(s) you are considering.**\*\*
We are interested in using the same sites as we planned in lab 1: a general open area for the scare bot, an office for the office bot, and an open floor area for the dance bot. Below are our story board sketches:

And below is a photo of the area under consideration:

\*\***Document the activities being considered.**\*\*
We are continuing to consider the interactions proposed last week: (1) the robot uses its light and sudden movement to scare somebody, (2) the robot bumps into colleagues in the break room, and (3) the robot enters a dance circle and shows off its moves. 

\*\***What issues or opportunties arise from the site and activities?**\*\*
In situation (1), we need to consider how the human will react to fear. For starters, the robot is actually quite small so it needs to be in a relative position of power in order to scare the human at all-- that is, no longer at foot level. Additionally, we must consider how the human responds. We do not actually have any intention of proposing any danger to the human or to the robot-- it should just be play and fun. 

In situation (2), the humans could accidentally step on the robot or spill coffee on it since it is below them by the table. 

In situation (3), we want to make sure that the humans are aware of the robots presence and, just as they would give a human their space and respect, that they are conscious of the space the robot needs to do its thing. I can imagine that in a crowded space, the clothing of the robot may be stepped on or snagged.

## Part C. Costume the robot

Only now should you start worrying about what the device should look like. Develop one costume so that CloneBot can fit into it's setting.

Think about the setting of the device: is the environment a place where the device could overheat? Is water a danger? 

Pick one of the custumes and make it with paper or cardboard or any other material!

\*\***Include sketches of what your robot might look like here.**\*\*

\*\***Include photos of your custumed robot here.**\*\*

\*\***What concerns or opportunitities are influencing the way you've designed the robot to look?**\*\*
A primary concern with dressin the mummy robot was how to make the robot look fully encased, as a mummy is, but without blocking any of the robot functions. For example, we needed to consider alternative places to wrap the bandages around so that the wheels would not be caught on the cloth. Additionally, we want the light to be apparent and strong, so we do not want the bandages to block it. We also want to think about how the wires will interact with the bandages. We ended up finding that the bandages actually made the wires easier to work with, because it acted as a sort of skin, holding the wires in so they no longer stuck out.


## Part D. Wizard the Robot
Take a little time to set up the wizarding set-up that allows for someone to remotely control the robot while someone interacts with it. Hint: You can use Zoom to record videos, and you can pin someone’s video feed if that is the scene which you want to record. 

\*\***Include your first attempts at recording the set-up video here.**\*\*
In one of our early attempts, we wanted to see how the robot might run on a table surface. Notice in the video that when it does the spinning, we are unsure whether it may fall off the table.

Also we include photos of us figuring out the framing for the shot:

\*\***Show the follow-up work here.**\*\*
In our final interaction, we moved to a longer table and only operated the forward and light movements.

## Part E. Record

\*\***Take videos of your prototyped interaction.**\*\*

\*\***Please indicate anyone you collaborated with on this Lab.**\*\*
Be generous in acknowledging their contributions! And also recognizing any other influences (e.g. from YouTube, Github, Twitter) that informed your design. 


\*\***Document everything here. (Particularly, we would like to see the storyboard and video, although photos of the prototype are also great.)**\*\*
